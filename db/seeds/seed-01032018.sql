  'This year I got the pleasure of being home for two weeks for Christmas, so I wanted to really commit to making Christmas cookies. I mean, really commit. I have a huge family and I decided to make them all a dozen macarons. I started the week optimistic, first making a baby batch with a small portion of ingredients from Target, and they turned out GREAT! I thought, I''ve definitely got this. I can hammer these out in no time. Riding high, I took a glorious trip to Costco and bought the rest of my ingredients in bulk. I made my second batch right away. Not as strong, but passable. The next day, I told myself to experiment with flavors and colors. This is when things took a downturn. Every batch I made was worse after the previous. I was chruning out little batches of rocks. Defeated and cookieless, I went to bed with only the memory of my first batch floating in my head.',
  'The next day I committed to just plain OG almond macarons. No flavors, no colors. Just plain. That''s when I got to WERK. I got into a good rhythm, and two days later, I had made about 200 macaron shells. (And probably ate at least 50, you know, for ...tasting... purposes. The last day, I told myself, maybe just maybe, I can play with chocolate. It seemed like a pipe dream, but after batch number 3 it worked! I banged out 100 chocolate shells soon after. The following day, I made all of the icing, and that''s when I incorporated flavors. The shells had a nice almond flavor, but I wanted to make flavored buttercream so you could at least differentiate the cookies in the box. I wrapped them all up the day before Christmas, and like a true little Santa, I passed them out the night before Christmas.',
  'I want to say they were a hit, but my cousin is an amazing baker and apaprently had the same thought I did, so he churned out much prettier and tastier macarons, but at least I got some good instagrams, and really at the end of the day, that''s all that matters.',
