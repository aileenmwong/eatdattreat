  'This year I got the pleasure of being home for two weeks for Christmas, so I wanted to really commit to making Christmas cookies. I mean, really commit. I have a huge family and I decided to make them all a dozen macarons. I started the week optimistic, first making a baby batch with a small portion of ingredients from Target, and they turned out GREAT! I thought, I''ve definitely got this. I can hammer these out in no time. Riding high, I took a glorious trip to Costco and bought the rest of my ingredients in bulk. I made my second batch right away. Not as strong, but passable. The next day, I told myself to experiment with flavors and colors. This is when things took a downturn. Every batch I made was worse after the previous. I was chruning out little batches of rocks. Defeated and cookieless, I went to bed with only the memory of my first batch floating in my head.',
  'The next day I committed to just plain OG almond macarons. No flavors, no colors. Just plain. That''s when I got to WERK. I got into a good rhythm, and two days later, I had made about 200 macaron shells. (And probably ate at least 50, you know, for ...tasting... purposes. The last day, I told myself, maybe just maybe, I can play with chocolate. It seemed like a pipe dream, but after batch number 3 it worked! I banged out 100 chocolate shells soon after. The following day, I made all of the icing, and that''s when I incorporated flavors. The shells had a nice almond flavor, but I wanted to make flavored buttercream so you could at least differentiate the cookies in the box. I wrapped them all up the day before Christmas, and like a true little Santa, I passed them out the night before Christmas.',
  'I want to say they were a hit, but my cousin is an amazing baker and apaprently had the same thought I did, so he churned out much prettier and tastier macarons, but at least I got some good instagrams, and really at the end of the day, that''s all that matters.',

  'Happy Birthday to me! My best friend this year gifted me with a dream gift - a Momofuku birthday cake baking class. I''ve always weirdly fantasized about making layer cakes, but for some reason have never attempted them. I don''t know if it''s the whole idea of making a stable cake or just the sheer volume of batter you have to put into it, but they''ve always been on my do not try list. I even one time made a pizza cake (yes, that''s right, a cake made of pizza). Momofuku offers these wonderful classes where you can make the actual treats they sell in store, so she bought me a gift certificate and off we went.',
  'At the class, they provide you with prebaked sheets of cake, frosting, and cookie crumbles for you to build your own beautiful cake. You cut out the circle cake shape out of a single sheet pan layer of cake and begin to build. They reveal to you their secrets about how to make the best birthday cake flavor, how to build the cake itself, and what to do with the leftovers. It was so simple, and I was so pleased with my own creation. Maybe now I''ll be brave enough to make a sheet cake on my own. Maybe.',

  'When my best friend told me you could get a cocktail in a gumball machine, I was SOLD. We ventured to a bar in the city for some Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory cocktails, and we were in for a treat!',
  'We first got the gumball cocktail which as delightful looking as it was, tasted awful. I suppose that was on me. The next cocktail we got were these delightful candy looking cocktails made with egg whites. They were scrum-diddly-umtious! However, the delightful lollipop on top of the cocktail was ... paper. All in all, I think it''s safe to say that we did it for the gram.',

  'My boyfriend and I recently went on a trip to Asia and on the last leg of our trip we went to Shanghai. We had been running around all of Shanghai and Hong Kong for the past week and we were exhausted. In Shanghai there is a road called ''Shouning Road,'' which is translated to Crawfish Road. At night, all of the vendors on this road will serve you crawfish by weight, and you chow down. It was the one thing that I wanted to go to, and when nighttime rolled around, we were so tired that we fell asleep at 8pm and totally missed out since we were flying back the next afternoon. Disappointed, we decided to go back in the morning in hopes that a vendor would be mercifully open in the morning. Instead, we discovered that crawfish road was this amazing breakfast market. No tourists around (well except us), vendors just cook on the side of the road. Since only locals visit, they have buckets next to their stalls where you toss in your money and they hand you a treat. No one asks how much things cost, no one counts money.',
  'We ate so many delicious things, but the real highlight was the sheng jian bao. It''s a fried soup dumpling with a thicker, yeasty skin. It was incredible. The soup was wonderfully flavored and with 10+ dumplings in the container, we couldn''t even finish them all and had to sadly toss the rest. I think about those soup dumplings all the time, you can''t even get them in the paradise of NYC Chinatown. Soup dumplings themselves are difficult to make, and I think trying to master these would be nearly impossible. Instead I''ll just have to dream about them until we bounce through Asia on the next trip, hopefully sooner rather than later.',
